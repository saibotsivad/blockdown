# Blockdown

A Markdown-like syntax that supports defining blocks of text.

## Introduction

If you are using Markdown with Front Matter, your existing Markdown files are probably already valid Blockdown! ðŸŽ‰

Blockdown does not have opinions about which flavor of Markdown you should use, or which plugins you should support.

Instead, it defines text blocks in such a way that *you* can decide what to do with them.

## Why?

A typical Markdown blog post, using Front Matter, might look like this:

```
---
title: My Post
---

Some exciting words.
```

Suppose that you want to include a graph in the middle, using a library like [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/)?

You might be tempted to write something like:

```
---
title: My Post
---

Some exciting words.

<div class="mermaid" data-size="large">
    pie title NETFLIX
        "Time spent looking for movie" : 90
        "Time spent watching it" : 10
</div>

More words.
```

Then when you convert the Markdown file to HTML you would look for elements with the CSS `.mermaid` selector, grab the text, generate a chart, then plug it back in to your HTML.

Sounds doable but... if only there was a better way... ðŸ¤”

## How it Works

With Blockdown, you define each block of text explicitly, using a delimiter that's easy for humans and computers alike to read:

* `---!name` The delimiter **must** have a name, which is usually the content type, e.g. `mermaid`.
* `---!name#id` It can also include an identifier, if you need to identify a unique block.
* `---!name[metadata]` It can also include metadata, for things like display settings.
* `---!name#id[metadata]` Of course, it can include an identifier *and* metadata.

> Note: The metadata is enclosed in square brackets, but the exact syntax of the metadata is **not** specified by Blockdown. Blockdown syntax ***does not care***â€“it leaves metadata interpretation up to you.

Our earlier example, written in fully explicit format, would be:

```
---!yaml
title: My Post

---!md

Some exciting words.

---!mermaid[size=large]

pie title NETFLIX
    "Time spent looking for movie" : 90
    "Time spent watching it" : 10

---!md

More words.
```

Blockdown syntax doesn't care what the contents are, it only cares about separating the text contents into blocks, and leaves interpreting those blocks up to you.

Each block in a Blockdown document contains the following possible properties:

* `name` *(String, required)* The name of the block, e.g. for `---!yaml` the `name` would be `yaml`.
* `id` *(String, optional)* The optional identifier of the block, e.g. for `---!yaml#abc` the `id` would be `abc`.
* `metadata` *(String, optional)* The optional metadata string of whatever is between the square brackets, e.g. for `---!yaml#abc[foo]` or `---!yaml[foo]` the `metadata` would be `foo`.
* `content` *(String, optional)* Any characters following the block delimiter, up to the next block delimiter or the end of the file.

## Backwards Compatibility

For backwards compatibility with Markdown + [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) documents, if the very first line is `---` then the following block is interpreted as Front Matter, up to the next Blockdown delimiter or `---` separator.

If the `---` separator is used (instead of a Blockdown delimiter), the following block is treated as Markdown.

So our earlier example could simply be:

```
---
title: My Post
---

Some exciting words.

---!mermaid[size=large]

pie title NETFLIX
    "Time spent looking for movie" : 90
    "Time spent watching it" : 10

---!md

More words.
```

## Multi-Line Metadata

You may find that single-line metadata gets cumbersome with large metadata sets.

To use multi-line metadata, you end the delimiter with `[` (the left square bracket), and close the metadata section with a line containing only the `]` character (right square bracket).

For example:

```
---!mermaid[
  size=large
  color=red
]

pie title NETFLIX
	"Time spent looking for movie" : 90
	"Time spent watching it" : 10

---!md

More words.
```

> Note: the indentation of the metadata here is optional.

## Implementation

This project ships with a JavaScript implementation.

Simply import the `parse` function and pass it the string:

```js
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { parse } from '@saibotsivad/blockdown';

const blockdown = parse(readFileSync('./test/many-chunks.md', 'utf8'));
console.log(blockdown.blocks[3].metadata); // => 'fizz3'
```

### API: `parse(<String>): Object<blocks: Array, warnings: Array>`

This implementation has a very simple API, you simply call the `parse` function with the string you want parsed.

The returned object contains two potential properties:

#### `blocks: Array<Object>`

The `blocks` property is an array of all parsed Blockdown blocks, it
contains the following properties:

* `name` (`String`, optional) - The name of the block, e.g. for `---!yaml` this property would be `yaml`.
* `id` (`String`, optional) - The `id` of the block, e.g. for `---!yaml#part1` this property would be `part1`.
* `metadata` (`String`, optional) - The metadata exactly as represented in the Blockdown block, e.g. without metadata type parsing or de-indentation on multi-line metadata.
* `content` (`String`, optional) - The content between block delimiters.

### `warnings: Array<Object>`

The `warnings` property is an array of all recoverable parser errors encountered. The array will always exist, but if there were no errors it will be empty.

It contains the following properties:

* `index` (`Integer`) - The zero-index line number where the error was first detected.
* `code` (`String`) - The meant-for-machines name of the error type. (As of `1.1.0`, only `UNPARSEABLE_MARKER` is used.)
* `line` (`String`) - The text found at the line where the error was first detected.
